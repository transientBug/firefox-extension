# Bookmarking the www-bugs
This is the officially supported firefox extension for the transientBug
bookmarking service.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/transientBug/firefox-extension.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/transientBug/firefox-extension)

TODO: This.

## Development: Getting Started
You can git clone this repo and load the extension into firefox temporarily,
visit `about:debugging` or see [this MDN doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox)

Currently, the latest node 8 version is used for the various development tools.
After that: `yarn install`
And `npm run test` to lint all the things.

No actual tests outside of linting happens for now, but contributions are
welcomed :)
